# CircleCI Demo React JS App

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/pelican-bookstore/bookstore.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/pelican-bookstore/bookstore)

This is an example application demonstrating a simple JavaScript app built with React using CircleCI 2.0, 2.1 and 2.0 CircleCI Server configuration. 

The README includes samples of different CircleCI features, including workspace, dependency caching, and parallelism. These configs use feature from CircleCI 2.1, including reusable commands and executors.

To see how we would use orbs to checkout, build, and test in one line, please see the 2.1-orbs-config branch.

To see these features in a version 2.0 config, please see the master branch.
Sample configurations: version 2.0

    * Building and testing with reusable cache commands
    * Reusing commands in commands
    * Running with multiple executors
